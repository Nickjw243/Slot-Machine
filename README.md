## Python Slot Machine

This is a Python based Slot Machine project that I practiced with from TechWithTim on YouTube. This is a CLI application and I learned new processes for Python as well as practiced coding in Python.

To get started, open the code in VSCode and make sure you are in the root Slot-Machine directory that has main.py. Then you can just run "python main.py" in the terminal and that will start the CLI application.

Hope you enjoy!
